Stuff that currently doesn't work:

* Some games don't work

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stuff that I might fix:

* Sound may be a bit off, but I don't know if that's just my ALSA drivers or
  something with the core.
* SA-1 games are slow, could use some optimization.
